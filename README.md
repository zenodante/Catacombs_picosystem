# This is the PicoSystem verson for Catacombs's Pokitto version created by Jhhoward 
(original code: https://github.com/jhhoward/Catacombs-Pokitto )

Added sound volume setting at title page
Optimized the 120*120 ARGB4444 display mode on Picosystem

I hacked the default audio callback function and add a new simple callback to porcess the tones sequence.
